What I'm basically after is [Posh-Git](https://github.com/dahlbyk/posh-git)-like status summary (`[master +0 ~2 -1 | +1 ~1 -0]`) in VS statusbar. It looks like [there is no such thing](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21060696/is-there-vs-analogue-for-vims-powerline) at the moment.

I've just hacked up some ugly dirtiness to be able to write current branch name into status bar on menu command. Nothing usable here yet.
