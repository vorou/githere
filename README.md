NOT TESTED AT ALL, it will steal your soul and set your machine on fire, use at your risk.

installation
============

*I'm building it on Windows 8.1 x64, VS 2013 Premium. You also need to have [VS 2013 SDK](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40758) installed.*

Open the solution in VS, build it, install the resulting VSIX file.
